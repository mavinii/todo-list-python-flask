# CA4 Flask TODO App
- Student n: `22931`
- Student name: `Marcos Oliveira`
- Tutor: [Geoff-Wright](https://github.com/Geoff-Wright)

This is a simple Flask app for managing a todo list, with items stored in a MongoDB database. The app allows users to submit new items with a content and degree field, where degree can be either "Important" or "Unimportant". The app then displays all the items in the database on the same page.

## `/home`:
This is the home page that users will see when they first access the website

  <img alt="BetterDay" src="./web/preview/preview.png" >
</p>

## `/login`:
This route handles user login. If the user enters an invalid username or password, it displays an error message. Otherwise, it sets the session variable and redirects the user to the home page.

</p>

## `/register`:
This route handles user registration. If the user is already registered, it displays an error message. Otherwise, it hashes the password using bcrypt and inserts the new user into the database.

</p>

## `/todo`:
This route displays the todo page. The login_required decorator is used to make sure that only logged in users can access this page. If a user is not logged in, they will be redirected to the login page.

</p>

## `/delete`:
This route handles the deletion of todo items. It takes the id of the item to be deleted as a parameter and deletes it from the database.

</p>

## `mydb.users`:
MongoDB Atlas database that stores the users collection.

## `mydb.todos`:
MongoDB Atlas database that stores the todos collection.

## Requirements
To run this app, you need:

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- PyMongo
- Installation
- Clone the repository:

## In the App
Set up the MongoDB Atlas cluster and create a user with read/write access to a database and a collection. Then, replace:
```python
# Instance of the MongoClient class from the PyMongo library
client = MongoClient('mongodb+srv://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@cluster0.tbouul8.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority')

# Make sure to replace <username>, <password>, <clustername>, and <dbname> with the appropriate values for your MongoDB Atlas cluster.
```

## Run the app

Copy and run this code:
> python app.py

In your browser, go to `http://localhost:5000` to see the app in action.

## Usage
To use the app, simply enter a new todo item in the form and choose its `Important` or `Unimportant`, then click the "Submit" button. The new item will be added to the database and displayed on the same page. You can add as many items as you want and they will all be persisted in the database.

## Acknowledgments
This app was built with Flask and PyMongo, using MongoDB Atlas for cloud database hosting. The HTML and CSS for the app were adapted from a template found on `Bootstrap`.
